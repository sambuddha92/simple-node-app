## Introduction

This is a step-by-step guide to build a simple nodejs web app with an express server and connect to a remote github repository. I am using macOS so windows or linux users may have to adapt where necessary.

The web app just sends okay. but the focus on this article is to set up a connection with github.

## Pre-requisites

- An IDE. I prefer [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- node and npm on your local system: Check if they are installed using `node -v` and `npm -v` commands. If not found, then install using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- A [github](https://github.com/) account
- Basic understanding of using VS Code and the command line

## Build the nodejs App

### Initiate the project

1. Create an empty folder named simple-node-app on your computer and open it on vs code.
2. Open the terminal on VS Code using command palette or pressing the `control` and `~` keys together
3. Run the command `npm init -y`. This initiates the node project. The `-y` tag accepts all defaults.

Now we should have

### Create the express application

1. Create an empty file named `index.js` in your root folder by running the command `touch index.js`
2. Install Express using npm: `npm i express`. (This should create a file named `package-lock.json` and a directory named `node_modules`.)
3. Put the following code block in the `index.js` file:

```js
/**
 * Import the express module and initiate the express app
 */
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

/**
 * Set up the app to return "Okay" for any get request
 *
 * app.get() is the method to set up the app to do certain actions
 * upon a get request is sent to the app in the specified route.
 *
 * In this case we are using "*" indicating that the app should just
 * send "Okay" as a response to any get request to any route on the
 * app.
 */
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Okay");
});

/**
 * Set up the PORT
 *
 * app.listen() is a method to set up the app to listen to the specified
 * PORT - meaning if we go to http://localhost:8080 on our browser, this
 * app responds. Here we are setting up the app to listen to PORT 8080 and
 * once the app is running, it should log the given message on the console.
 */
const PORT = 8080;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server live on port ${PORT} ðŸ”¥`);
});
```

Now the application is ready. test it out:

1. Run `node index.js` on the terminal and we should see `Server live on port 8080 ðŸ”¥` on our console.
2. Go to any browser and paste and go to the url `http://localhost:8080` and we should see "Okay".

## Install and setup git

### Install git

1. Check if you already have git installed using `git -v`.
2. If not found, install git on your system globally using npm: `npm i git -g`.

### Set up git for this project

Create a file named `.gitignore` on your root folder and put the following in the file:

```gitignore
.DS_Store
node_modules
```

This file tells git to ignore the changes made to the files and folders mentioned here.

Next,

1. On the command line enter `git init`
2. Check the status of changes by running the command `git status`. It shows you the changes made on the directory so far.
3. Run the command `git add .` to stage all changes to commit.

## Connect with github remote repository

### Create empty gihub repository

1. Go to github.com and login to your account.
2. Click on create new reporitory.
3. Name the reporitory `simple-node-app` or anything of your choice.
4. Select private
